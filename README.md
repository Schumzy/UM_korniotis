# UM_korniotis

For the next year, I am studying at the University of Miami and while there will be assisting Dr. George Korniotis with a research project to investigate relationships with state-level economic data releases and movements in equity markets. 

This script gathers and formats data from the Beareau of Economic Analysis and the Beaureau of Labor Statistics. Although the purpose of the script isn't very glamorous, it turned out to be more of an ambitous endeavor than I originally anticipated but was an awesome learning experience. 

The script has a bit of tidyr, dplyr, and even a touch of very primitive web scraping. Similar to my other projects, this one also is probably not very elegant, but it got the job done. Will try to add in the other aspects of the project that aren't confidential as the research effort continues.

Thanks for taking a look.
